# Read all the things! 

![read](http://hemeramarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/read-all-the-things.jpg)

Welcome everyone to the Code Fellows Front-End Development Accelerator. Over the duration of this course the instructors will ask you to read a lot of things. Some will be suggested books and other will be recently posted articles on the Internet. 

This repo is yours to fork and contribute to. Add books/articles, read them and we HIGHLY SUGGEST that you write a 'blog' post about something that you learned from the assigned/suggested reading. 

What better way to get someone interested in the thing you just read other then writing a post about how awesome it is and what bits of info are lurking inside. o

### So, how does this work?

Simple really. Further down is a list of books/articles to read. You will FORK this repo and inside of your copy you can make updates to the list, check off the things you have read and add in additional markdown files as your `posts`.

I'd suggest making each post a separate directory in the repo and then adding a `readme.md` file to that directory. This will make it easy to click on the directory and Github automatically exposes the readme file. 

### Break things down

Please do not try to set some unrealistic goal about reading all the things in one shot. You will fail and you will not finish. So, how do we make this better?
Easy, read some, learning something, write down what you leaned and then read some more later. 

Bounce around. Read from one book today and then from another tomorrow. I don't really care. But what I do care about is that you are reading and learning. 

## What to read

The truth is ... there is so much to read that you can't read it all. But the good news is that we have read most of it already, so we can point you to the good books. 

Use this list as a guide. Learn things, read more, learn more things.
