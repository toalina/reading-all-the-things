This first chapter in jQuery Fundamentals gives an overview of the Javascript language, touches very briefly on jQuery basics.

* Commenting code:
  * Important to do! Every developer uses commenting in different fashions, but it is important for leaving clear notes for someone else when they look at the code

* Variables:
  *Variables are used to store values for use later. They can be text, numbers, data (arrays, objects), and code (functions). A rule of thumb is: If a value is used more than once, it can probably be stored in a variable

* Functions:
  * A function is a neat and small place to store a small piece of functionality of a bigger piece of cod. When a function is stored to a variable, we can call on this function expression by calling the variable

* Functions and variable scope:
  * Scope is very important when working with Javascript. Var statements that are declared inside functions are only available to that particular function. Var statements declared outside, on a global scope, are available anywhere in the code.
  * Variables with the same name, but in different scopes, are totally separate entities!
  * Things the book warns us about scope:
    1. Always declare variables with a var statement
    2. Variables declared inside function are not available outside of the function
    3. Variables without a var statement are always global!

* This:
  *‘This’ is a tricky one. It refers to an object that is in the same context of the function that it’s called in
  *The book uses a great example of a var person object. It shows how you cannot use ‘this’ to call something from outside of the object, in the global scope, because it cannot access the properties of the object (a more inner scope); therefore, returning undefined when it was called.
  *Scope is very important!

* Naming conventions:
  * Things to remember with naming conventions:
    1. Names that begin with _ are usually “private”
    2. Names begin with uppercase are usually constructors, to create new instances of objects
    3. $ are for jQuery objects
