Chapter 2 continued to discuss fundamentals of the Javascript language. It discussed expressions vs statements, variables, keywords, functions, return value (I have the most trouble with this one), various loops, and capitalizations and writing conventions. As the book explains the differences between various loops, it recommends to start a counter at 0 rather than 1 for good practice and habit.

Expressions and statements seem simple to decipher by definition, but I still have trouble deciphering between the two. In the book, it explained, “A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.” I think that is a great way to remind myself how to specify and accurately apply an expression when writing out a function. “If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a Javascript statement corresponds to a full sentence in a human language.” These descriptions of expressions vs statements in the book should be active reminders when I’m writing larger blocks of code in Javascript, and to know how to design my code most accurately and carefully.

The book explains a return value as any value that a function produces. Whenever the code runs, it spits out an “answer” and returns that answer to you, which you may use in another block of code. The book explains, “anything that produces a value is an expression, which means function calls can be used within larger expressions.” From my F2 class, my instructor explained a few things about Return:

* Return is a keyword that only does stuff when it’s inside a function
* Return stops execution of the function, and spits back some value
* Every function has a return value. That value is undefined by default. If you don’t put a ‘return’ in the function, it’ll just give you undefined back.
* You can tell ‘return’ to have the value of whatever you want: strings, numbers, an array, an object, another function… As long as it’s a valid data type, it can be the return value

My battle with Return Value continues…
