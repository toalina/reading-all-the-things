Chapter 1 explored different types of values and operators in JavaScript. It also discussed the importance between NaN (which is not a number), null (no value) and undefined (which is not defined, while NaN and null are defined, as a number and an object respectively). In writing JavaScript, a backslash ( \ ) may be used inside quoted text to “escape” the character, and will be continued within the same string rather than breaking out of the string. A couple special characters can also be used with a backslash, including ‘n’ (to interpret as a newline) and ‘t’ (to interpret as a tab character). Chapter 1 also discussed type coercion, which may occur when using the non-strict comparison operators (only 2 equal signs).
